# OpenSMOKEppInterface
C and Python interface for the [OpenSMOKE++ library](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2015.02.014)

## üì¶ Requirements
The library relies on the following external dependencies:
* **OpenSMOKE++** (_not provided with this repository_)
* [**Boost**](https://www.boost.org)
* [**Eigen**](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [**Config++**](https://hyperrealm.github.io/libconfig/)

OpenSMOKE++ and Eigen are headers-only, while the others must be compiled or installed using your preferred package manager.

### üöÄ BLAS Support for performance
To speed up mathematical operations, one of the following libraries must also be installed:
* [**OpenBLAS**](http://www.openmathlib.org/OpenBLAS/)
* [**Intel MKL**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
Create the following environment variables to store the paths to the OpenSMOKE++ library and the OpenSMOKEppInterface repository.
For example:
```
export OPENSMOKE_LATEST=${HOME}/OpenSMOKE/OpenSMOKEppMinimal4Basilisk/source
```
```
export OPENSMOKE_INTERFACE=${HOME}/OpenSMOKE/OpenSMOKEppInterface
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
The default installation tool for this library is [CMake](https://cmake.org), which attempts to automatically find the dependency libraries if they are installed in standard locations.
Assuming you are using OpenBLAS, compile the project with the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DOPENSMOKE_USE_OPENBLAS=1 ..
make
```

If any errors occur during compilation, make sure that CMake is detecting the correct paths. Below is an example of the CMake output
```
...
-- Found Boost: /opt/homebrew/lib/cmake/Boost-1.85.0/BoostConfig.cmake (found version "1.85.0") found components: date_time filesystem program_options system regex timer chrono 
-- Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS    = /opt/homebrew/include
-- Boost_LIBRARIES       = Boost::date_time;Boost::filesystem;Boost::program_options;Boost::system;Boost::regex;Boost::timer;Boost::chrono
-- Found Eigen3: /opt/homebrew/include/eigen3 (Required is at least version "2.91.0") 
-- Eigen_LIBRARIES       = /opt/homebrew/include/eigen3
-- OpenSmoke++           = /Users/ecipriano/OpenSMOKE/OpenSMOKEppMinimal4Basilisk/source
-- CONFIG++_INCLUDE_DIR  = /Users/ecipriano/Local/libconfig/build/include
-- CONFIG++_LIBRARY      = /Users/ecipriano/Local/libconfig/build/lib/libconfig++.dylib
-- OpenBLAS_INCLUDE_DIRS = /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openblas/0.3.27/include
-- BLAS_LIBRARIES        = /opt/homebrew/Cellar/openblas/0.3.27/lib/libopenblas.dylib
...
```

If a library is not found automatically by CMake (e.g., if it was installed in a non-standard location), you can manually specify the path in the `cmake` command. For example, to specify the OpenBLAS library path:
```
cmake -DOPENSMOKE_USE_OPENBLAS=1 -DOpenBLAS_ROOT=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openblas/0.3.27 ..
```
